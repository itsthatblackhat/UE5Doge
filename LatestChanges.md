## üöÄ ReadyPlayerDoge Inventory System Updates

### **Date: 2024-11-11**

## üÜï Features Added:
1. **Dynamic Inventory Initialization**:
   - Added support for dynamically initializing inventory slots based on grid size (`GridWidth` and `GridHeight`).
   - Implemented `PopulateInventorySlots()` function to dynamically populate the inventory slots in the UI.

2. **Inventory Slot Widget**:
   - Enhanced `UInventorySlotWidget` to handle item data display, including name, icon, and quantity.
   - Added support for displaying item details upon clicking a slot.
   - Integrated drag-and-drop functionality to move items between slots:
     - `NativeOnMouseButtonDown()` for detecting drag initiation.
     - `NativeOnDragDetected()` for creating drag operations.
     - `NativeOnDrop()` for handling item swapping between slots.
   - Added `SetItemData()` function to update slot with item details.
   - Improved `UpdateSlotDisplay()` to dynamically update the item display.

3. **Item Details Display**:
   - Implemented `DisplayItemDetails()` in `UInventoryUI` to show item details (name, icon, and value) when an inventory slot is clicked.
   - Added Blueprint bindings to update item details in the UI.

4. **Transaction Notification System**:
   - Added support for displaying transaction results (success or failure) in the inventory UI.
   - Implemented `DisplayTransactionResult()` function with color-coded notifications (green for success, red for failure).
   - Added `HideTransactionNotification()` to automatically hide the notification after 3 seconds.

5. **Blueprint Integration**:
   - Set up Blueprint interfaces (`WBP_InventoryUI` and `WBP_InventorySlotWidget`) to interact with the C++ inventory system.
   - Added new variables and event bindings to Blueprint widgets to reflect changes in the inventory system.

## üîÑ Improvements & Refactoring:
1. **Optimized Inventory Core**:
   - Refactored `AInventoryCore` functions to better manage item additions, removals, and swapping.
   - Simplified slot item access using the `GetItemFromSlot()` function.

2. **UI Code Cleanup**:
   - Reduced redundant code in `InventorySlotWidget.cpp` and `InventoryUI.cpp`.
   - Streamlined `InitializeInventory()` and `PopulateInventorySlots()` for better readability and performance.
   - Updated `SetItemData()` to include quantity as a parameter for future support of stackable items.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Enhancements**:
   - Improved the drag-and-drop logic to handle edge cases and ensure smooth item transfers.
   - Added visual feedback for slot interactions during drag-and-drop operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes:
1. **Fixed Compilation Errors**:
   - Resolved issues with mismatched function signatures and missing includes.
   - Addressed issues with incomplete type errors and undeclared identifiers.

2. **Slot Display Fixes**:
   - Fixed issues where slot widgets were not properly displaying updated item information.
   - Resolved problems with item details not clearing correctly when an empty slot is clicked.

3. **Transaction System Fixes**:
   - Fixed transaction notifications not displaying correctly due to incorrect bindings.
   - Ensured that transaction messages hide after the specified delay.
