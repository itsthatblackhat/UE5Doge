The .cpp file and .h file should go into your unreal engine project under a 'Dogecoin' folder.
The files under RPDHandler, should be ran separately from the game client for operations.

You will also need to be hosting a dogecoin node on your computer or point to the node you wish to use in the source.


also for testnet here is my config file..
if you're on windows it will be under:
c:\users\somecooldude\AppData\Roaming\Dogecoin\
-------------------------------------------------
testnet=1
server=1
rpcuser=pooperdinkles
rpcpassword=pooperdinkles
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=18332
-------------------------------------------------

Run the dogecoin node, 
Run the RPDHandler,
Rule the world
